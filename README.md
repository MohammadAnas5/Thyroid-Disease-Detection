# 🦋 Thyroid Disease Detection

🚀 **[Try the live application here!](https://thyroid-disease-detection32.onrender.com)**

Welcome to the **Thyroid Disease Detection** project! This application leverages machine learning to predict the presence of thyroid disease based on various medical parameters.

## 🌟 Project Overview

This project is a Flask-based web application designed to predict thyroid disease using a machine learning model. Users can input medical data through an intuitive web interface, and the application provides predictions that can assist in early detection of thyroid conditions.

## 🚀 Features

- **Accurate Predictions**: Leverages a trained machine learning model to predict thyroid disease with high accuracy.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A clean and responsive front-end that makes it easy for users to input their data.
- **Robust Error Handling**: Implements logging and error handling for a seamless user experience.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to be easily extendable with additional features or datasets.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Flask, Python
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-Learn, NumPy
- **Data Handling**: Pandas
- **Model Storage**: Pickle

## 🧑‍💻 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- Scikit-Learn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Thyroid-Disease-Detection.git
    cd Thyroid-Disease-Detection
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the application:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

## 🧪 How It Works

1. **Data Input**: Users fill out a form with medical information related to thyroid conditions.
2. **Data Processing**: The application processes the input data and converts it into a format suitable for the model.
3. **Prediction**: The trained machine learning model predicts whether the user is likely to have a thyroid condition.
4. **Result Display**: The prediction result is displayed on the web interface.
